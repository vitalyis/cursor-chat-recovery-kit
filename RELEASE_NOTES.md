## What is This?

Cursor Chat Recovery Kit helps you recover and migrate your Cursor IDE chat history when workspace folders are renamed or lost. Never lose your valuable AI conversations again!

## The Problem It Solves

Have you ever renamed a project folder in Cursor and suddenly lost all your chat history? This happens because Cursor creates a new workspace ID for renamed folders, leaving your chat history "orphaned" in the old workspace. Your conversations aren't actually deleted—they're just no longer linked to your project.

This toolkit solves that problem and much more.

## Key Features

### Smart Chat History Migration

- Automatically find and migrate chat history between renamed folders
- Works with partial folder name matching
- Supports multiple backup versions
- One-command migration: `cursor-migrate 'OldName' 'NewName'`

### Automated Backup System

- Set up automatic backups every 4 hours
- Manual backup on demand
- Intelligent backup management (keeps last 5 snapshots)
- Complete workspace snapshots with metadata

### Emergency Recovery

- Full workspace recovery from corruption or data loss
- Workspace health diagnostics
- Multiple recovery points
- Safe restore with automatic pre-restore backups

### Chat Export & Analysis

- Export chat conversations to Markdown format
- Chat index generation for easy browsing
- Organize exports by backup timestamp and workspace
- Preserve conversation flow and context

### Workspace Discovery Tools

- List all workspaces and their details
- Find workspace IDs by folder path
- Explore backup contents
- Compare workspace sizes and dates
